# Assignment 2: Randomized Optimization

## Objective

Purpose is to explore random search. 
Implement several randomized search algorithms. 
Create problems that excercise the strengths of each method.

## Procedure

**Must implement three local random search algorithms**
- Randomized Hill Climbing
- Simulated Annealing
- A genetic algorithm

You will then create two optimization problem domains. 
An "optimization problem" is a fitness function one is trying to maximize (as opposed to a cost function one is trying to minimize)
The problems you create should be over discrete-valued parameter spaces. Bit string are preferable.

You will apply all three search techniques to these two optimization problems. 
The first problem should highlight advantages with simulated annealing
The second should discuss the genetic algorithm.

Example: The 4-peaks and k-color problems are rather straightforward, but illustrate relative strengths rather neatly.

## Extra Credit

Implement an additional search algorithm, MIMIC, to the SECOND optimization problem as a comparison to the genetic algorithms. 
To receive full points you need to give a visualization or measure with reasonable explanation.

## 3.2 The Problems Given to You
In addition to analyzing discrete optimization problems, you will also use the first three algorithms to find good weights for a neural network. In particular, you will use them instead of backprop for the neural network you used in Assignment 1 on at least one of the problems you created for Assignment 1. Notice that this assignment is about an optimization problem and about supervised learning problems. That means that looking at only the loss or only the accuracy will not tell you the whole story. You will need to integrate your knowledge on optimization problem analysis and supervised learning nuances to craft a detailed report.

Below are common pitfalls:
- The weights in a neural network are continuous and real-valued instead of discrete so you might want to
think a little bit about what it means to apply these sorts of algorithms in such a domain.
- There are different loss and activation functions for NNs. If you use different libraries across your assignments,
you either need to make sure those are the same or retune your model using the new library.

## Experiments and Analysis
Including consideration from your Assignment 1 report for experiments and analysis, your Assignment 2 report
should contain:
- The results you obtained running the algorithms on the networks. Why did you get the results you did?
- What sort of changes might you make to each of those algorithms to improve performance? Supporting graphs and/or tables should be included to help with arguments and strengthen hypotheses.
- A description of your optimization problems, and why you feel that they are interesting and exercise the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Think hard about this. To be interesting the problems should be non-trivial on the one hand, but capable of admitting comparisons and analysis of the various algorithms on the other.
- You must contain a hypothesis about the optimization problems. Must like the previous assignment, this is open-ended. Whatever hypothesis you choose, you will need to back it up with experimentation and thorough discussion. It is not enough to just show results.
- Understanding of each algorithmâ€™s tuning for selected hyperparameter ranges. Please experiment with more than one hyperparameter and make sure the results and subsequent analysis you provide are meaningful. You are required to state your optimal parameters with rationale but not explicitly required to include graphs.
- Analyses of your results. Why did you get the results you did? Compare and contrast the different algorithms. What sort of changes might you make to each of those algorithms to improve performance?
- How fast were they in terms of wall clock time? Iterations? Would cross validation help? 
- How much  performance was due to the problems you chose? Which algorithm performed best? How do you define
best? Be creative and think of as many questions you can, and as many answers as you can.

### 3 Procedure

#### **3.1 The Problems You Give Us**

**Implementing Three Local Random Search Algorithms:**

1. **Randomized Hill Climbing:**
   - **Description:** Randomized Hill Climbing is an iterative optimization algorithm that starts with a random solution and iteratively makes small random changes to the current solution. If the change improves the solution, it is accepted; otherwise, it is discarded.
   - **Chapter Reference:** Chapter 4 of Tom Mitchell's "Machine Learning" may cover general optimization techniques related to hill climbing, and Chapter 11 discusses concepts of exploration and exploitation which are crucial to understanding hill climbing.
   - **Key Points:**
     - Start with an initial random solution.
     - Evaluate the fitness of the solution.
     - Make small random changes to the solution (neighboring solutions).
     - Accept changes that improve the fitness.
     - Repeat until convergence or a stopping criterion is met.
   - **Example Implementation (Python):**
     ```python
     import random

     def hill_climbing(fitness_function, initial_solution, iterations):
         current_solution = initial_solution
         current_fitness = fitness_function(current_solution)
         for _ in range(iterations):
             neighbor = generate_neighbor(current_solution)
             neighbor_fitness = fitness_function(neighbor)
             if neighbor_fitness > current_fitness:
                 current_solution, current_fitness = neighbor, neighbor_fitness
         return current_solution

     def generate_neighbor(solution):
         neighbor = solution[:]
         index = random.randint(0, len(solution) - 1)
         neighbor[index] = 1 - neighbor[index]  # Flip bit
         return neighbor
     ```

2. **Simulated Annealing:**
   - **Description:** Simulated Annealing is an optimization algorithm inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It allows occasional acceptance of worse solutions to escape local optima by gradually reducing the probability of such acceptances.
   - **Chapter Reference:** Chapter 4 and Chapter 13 (for relationship to dynamic programming) discuss optimization techniques and the concept of exploration vs. exploitation.
   - **Key Points:**
     - Start with an initial random solution and a high temperature.
     - At each iteration, generate a neighboring solution.
     - Calculate the change in fitness.
     - Accept the new solution if it improves fitness, or with a probability based on the temperature if it worsens fitness.
     - Gradually reduce the temperature.
     - Repeat until convergence or a stopping criterion is met.
   - **Example Implementation (Python):**
     ```python
     import math

     def simulated_annealing(fitness_function, initial_solution, initial_temp, cooling_rate, iterations):
         current_solution = initial_solution
         current_fitness = fitness_function(current_solution)
         temperature = initial_temp
         for _ in range(iterations):
             neighbor = generate_neighbor(current_solution)
             neighbor_fitness = fitness_function(neighbor)
             if (neighbor_fitness > current_fitness or 
                 random.random() < math.exp((neighbor_fitness - current_fitness) / temperature)):
                 current_solution, current_fitness = neighbor, neighbor_fitness
             temperature *= cooling_rate
         return current_solution
     ```

3. **Genetic Algorithm:**
   - **Description:** A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a population-based optimization algorithm inspired by natural selection. It evolves a population of solutions over generations using operations like selection, crossover, and mutation.
   - **Chapter Reference:** Chapter 9 covers genetic algorithms comprehensively.
   - **Key Points:**
     - Initialize a population of random solutions.
     - Evaluate the fitness of each solution.
     - Select solutions based on fitness (e.g., roulette wheel selection).
     - Apply crossover and mutation to create a new population.
     - Repeat the process for a set number of generations or until convergence.
   - **Example Implementation (Python):**
     ```python
     def genetic_algorithm(fitness_function, population_size, generations, crossover_rate, mutation_rate):
         population = [generate_random_solution() for _ in range(population_size)]
         for _ in range(generations):
             population = sorted(population, key=fitness_function, reverse=True)
             new_population = population[:2]  # Elitism, carry forward the best two solutions
             while len(new_population) < population_size:
                 parent1, parent2 = select_parents(population)
                 if random.random() < crossover_rate:
                     child1, child2 = crossover(parent1, parent2)
                 else:
                     child1, child2 = parent1, parent2
                 if random.random() < mutation_rate:
                     child1 = mutate(child1)
                 if random.random() < mutation_rate:
                     child2 = mutate(child2)
                 new_population.extend([child1, child2])
             population = new_population
         return max(population, key=fitness_function)

     def generate_random_solution():
         return [random.randint(0, 1) for _ in range(solution_length)]

     def select_parents(population):
         return random.choices(population, k=2, weights=[fitness_function(ind) for ind in population])

     def crossover(parent1, parent2):
         point = random.randint(1, len(parent1) - 1)
         return parent1[:point] + parent2[point:], parent2[:point] + parent1[point:]

     def mutate(solution):
         index = random.randint(0, len(solution) - 1)
         solution[index] = 1 - solution[index]
         return solution
     ```

**Creating Two Optimization Problem Domains:**

1. **Problem Highlighting Advantages with Simulated Annealing:**
   - **Example:** Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) where the goal is to find the shortest possible route visiting a set of cities exactly once and returning to the starting point. Simulated annealing can escape local optima, making it suitable for TSP.
   - **Fitness Function:** Negative of the total distance traveled (since we want to minimize distance).
   - **Parameter Space:** Permutations of city visits.

2. **Problem Highlighting Advantages with Genetic Algorithm:**
   - **Example:** Knapsack Problem where the goal is to maximize the total value of items packed in a knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity. Genetic algorithms can explore a large search space effectively.
   - **Fitness Function:** Total value of items packed (while ensuring the total weight is within capacity).
   - **Parameter Space:** Binary string representing the inclusion (1) or exclusion (0) of each item.

**Extra Credit Opportunity - Implementing MIMIC:**
- **MIMIC (Mutual Information Maximizing Input Clustering):** An optimization algorithm that combines ideas from genetic algorithms and estimation of distribution algorithms. It learns a probabilistic model of promising solutions and samples from this model to generate new solutions.

#### **3.2 The Problems Given to You**

### Important Information from the Textbook:

#### **5. Discussion**

**Hypothesis Testing:**
- **TSP Hypothesis:** Simulated annealing would outperform hill climbing due to its ability to escape local optima. This was confirmed through experiments.
