#### **6.2 Bayes Theorem**

**Title:** Introduction to Bayes Theorem

**Key Concepts:**
- **Bayes Theorem:** Provides a method to calculate the posterior probability of a hypothesis based on its prior probability and the likelihood of observed data.
- **Posterior Probability:** Updated probability of a hypothesis after considering the observed data.
- **Maximum A Posteriori (MAP):** Hypothesis with the highest posterior probability.
- **Maximum Likelihood (ML):** Hypothesis that maximizes the likelihood of the observed data.

**Important Equations:**
- **Bayes Theorem:** \( P(h|D) = \frac{P(D|h)P(h)}{P(D)} \)
- **MAP Hypothesis:** \( h_{MAP} = \arg\max_{h \in H} P(D|h)P(h) \)
- **ML Hypothesis:** \( h_{ML} = \arg\max_{h \in H} P(D|h) \)

**Example:**
- Medical diagnosis problem with probabilities for cancer presence and test outcomes.

**Concluding Remarks:**
Bayes Theorem is foundational for Bayesian learning, enabling the calculation of the most probable hypothesis given the observed data.

#### **6.4 Maximum Likelihood and Least-Squared Error Hypotheses**

**Title:** Connection Between Maximum Likelihood and Least-Squared Error

**Key Concepts:**
- **Continuous-Valued Target Function:** Learning functions that predict real-valued outputs.
- **Noise Assumption:** Training data values are noisy observations of the target function.
- **Least-Squared Error:** Minimizing this error yields the maximum likelihood hypothesis.

**Important Equations:**
- **Likelihood for Noisy Observations:** \( P(D|h) = \prod_{i=1}^{m} p(d_i|h) \)
- **Maximizing Log Likelihood:** \( h_{ML} = \arg\max_{h \in H} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \ln p(d_i|h) \)

**Concluding Remarks:**
Minimizing the sum of squared errors in noisy data settings aligns with finding the maximum likelihood hypothesis, justifying many learning algorithms' approaches.

**Important Equations:**
- **Cross Entropy:** \( H(p, q) = -\sum_{x} p(x) \ln q(x) \)

**Concluding Remarks:**
For probabilistic predictions, optimizing cross entropy is crucial for finding maximum likelihood hypotheses, especially in neural network training.

- **Performance:** Expected error is at most twice that of the Bayes optimal classifier.

**Concluding Remarks:**
The Gibbs algorithm provides a practical alternative to the Bayes optimal classifier with a manageable computational cost and reasonable performance.
