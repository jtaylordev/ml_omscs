## Chapter 4: Artificial Neural Networks

### 4.1 Introduction
Neural network learning methods provide a robust approach to approximating real-valued, discrete-valued, and vector-valued target functions. For certain types of problems, such as learning to interpret complex real-world sensor data, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are among the most effective learning methods currently known.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs):** Practical method for learning functions from examples.
- **Backpropagation Algorithm:** Uses gradient descent to tune network parameters to best fit a training set.
- **Applications:** Interpreting visual scenes, speech recognition, learning robot control strategies.

### 4.1.1 Biological Motivation
The study of ANNs is inspired by biological neural systems, which are composed of complex webs of interconnected neurons. ANNs mimic this structure by using interconnected simple units to process inputs and produce outputs.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Human Brain:** Contains approximately \(10^{11}\) neurons, each connected to \(10^4\) others.
- **Neuron Activity:** Typically excited or inhibited through connections to other neurons.
- **Neuron Switching Times:** On the order of \(10^{-3}\) seconds.

### 4.2 Neural Network Representations

**Key Concepts:**
- Neural network learning involves the use of networks to learn and represent complex functions.
- A notable example is the ALVINN system, which uses an ANN to steer an autonomous vehicle.
- ANNs consist of layers of interconnected units (nodes), where each unit takes multiple inputs and produces an output.

---

**Neural Network Structure:**
- **Input Layer:** Receives raw data (e.g., pixel intensities from a camera).
- **Hidden Layer(s):** Intermediate layers that transform input into more abstract representations.
- **Output Layer:** Produces the final output of the network (e.g., steering direction).

---

**Example: ALVINN System:**
- **Input:** 30x32 grid of pixel intensities from a forward-pointed camera.
- **Hidden Units:** Four units that compute outputs based on a weighted combination of 960 inputs.
- **Output Units:** 30 units corresponding to different steering directions.

---

**Detailed Explanation:**
1. **Input Layer:**
   - Each pixel value in the 30x32 grid is fed into the network as an input.
   - The total number of inputs is \(30 \times 32 = 960\).

2. **Hidden Layer:**
   - Four hidden units receive inputs from all 960 pixels.
   - Each hidden unit computes a weighted sum of its inputs and applies an activation function to produce its output.

3. **Output Layer:**
   - The outputs of the hidden units serve as inputs to the output layer.
   - Each of the 30 output units computes a steering direction based on the hidden unit outputs.

---

**Important Equations:**
- **Weighted Sum Calculation:**
  \[
  \text{net}_j = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{ji} x_i
  \]
  - \(\text{net}_j\): Net input to unit \(j\).
  - \(w_{ji}\): Weight from input \(i\) to unit \(j\).
  - \(x_i\): Input value \(i\).
  - \(n\): Total number of inputs.

- **Activation Function:**
  \[
  o_j = f(\text{net}_j)
  \]
  - \(o_j\): Output of unit \(j\).
  - \(f\): Activation function (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU).

---

**Pseudocode:**
```python
# Initialize network weights
initialize_weights()

# Forward pass
for each input example x:
    for each hidden unit h:
        net_h = sum(w_ji * x_i for each input i)
        o_h = activation_function(net_h)
    
    for each output unit k:
        net_k = sum(w_hk * o_h for each hidden unit h)
        o_k = activation_function(net_k)
    
    # Determine final output
    output = argmax(o_k for each output unit k)

# Example of an activation function (Sigmoid)
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + exp(-x))
```

            output_activations = [sigmoid(sum(w_hk * h for w_hk, h in zip(output_weights[k], hidden_activations))) for k in range(n_output)]
            
            # Compute output error

            # Update output weights
            for k in range(n_output):
                for j in range(n_hidden):
                    output_weights[k][j] += learning_rate * output_errors[k] * hidden_activations[j]
            
            # Update hidden weights
            for j in range(n_hidden):
                for i in range(n_input):
                    hidden_weights[j][i] += learning_rate * hidden_errors[j] * x[i]

    return hidden_weights, output_weights

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + exp(-x))

def initialize_weights(n_input, n_output):
    return [[random.uniform(-0.05, 0.05) for _ in range(n_input)] for _ in range(n_output)]
```

**4.5.3 Derivation of the Backpropagation Rule**

**Key Concepts:**
- The backpropagation rule is derived using gradient descent to minimize the error function.
- The rule updates the weights to reduce the difference between the network's output and the target values.

**Derivation Steps:**

1. **Calculate the Error for Output Units:**
   - For each output unit \(k\):
     \[
     \delta_k = (t_k - o_k) o_k (1 - o_k)
     \]
     - \(\delta_k\): Error term for output unit \(k\).
     - \(t_k\): Target output for unit \(k\).
     - \(o_k\): Actual output for unit \(k\).

2. **Calculate the Error for Hidden Units:**
   - For each hidden unit \(h\):
     \[
     \delta_h = o_h (1 - o_h) \sum_{k \in \text{outputs}} \delta_k w_{kh}
     \]
     - \(\delta_h\): Error term for hidden unit \(h\).
     - \(o_h\): Output of hidden unit \(h\).
     - \(w_{kh}\): Weight from hidden unit \(h\) to output unit \(k\).

3. **Update the Weights:**
   - For each weight \(w_{ji}\):
     \[
     \Delta w_{ji} = \eta \delta_j x_i
     \]
     - \(\eta\): Learning rate.
     - \(\delta_j\): Error term for unit \(j\).
     - \(x_i\): Input to unit \(j\).

**Conclusion:**
- The backpropagation algorithm iteratively updates the weights to minimize the error.
- By adjusting the weights based on the error gradients, the network learns to make more accurate predictions.

### 4.6 Remarks on the Backpropagation Algorithm

**Key Concepts:**
- Backpropagation implements a gradient descent search through the weight space of a neural network.
- The algorithm is effective but has limitations, such as the potential for getting trapped in local minima.
- The representational power of neural networks, the hypothesis space search, and the inductive bias are critical aspects to understand.

---

**4.6.1 Convergence and Local Minima**

**Key Concepts:**
- The error surface for multilayer networks can have multiple local minima, which can trap the gradient descent search.
- Although guaranteed to converge to some local minimum, backpropagation is not guaranteed to find the global minimum error.

**Important Points:**
- Local minima are less problematic in practice due to the high-dimensional weight space of large networks, offering more escape routes.
- The initialization of weights near zero leads to smoother decision surfaces in early iterations, potentially avoiding poor local minima.

**Strategies to Mitigate Local Minima:**
1. **Adding Momentum:**
   - Helps the gradient descent process move through narrow local minima and flat regions.
   \[
   \Delta w_{ji}(n) = \eta \delta_j x_i + \alpha \Delta w_{ji}(n-1)
   \]
   - \(\alpha\): Momentum term.

2. **Stochastic Gradient Descent:**
   - Uses individual training examples for weight updates, effectively descending different error surfaces and reducing the likelihood of getting stuck in a single local minimum.

3. **Training Multiple Networks:**
   - Initializing multiple networks with different random weights and selecting the best-performing network on a validation set.

**Pseudocode:**
```python
def backpropagation_with_momentum(training_data, learning_rate, momentum, n_hidden, n_output, epochs):
    hidden_weights = initialize_weights(n_input, n_hidden)
    output_weights = initialize_weights(n_hidden, n_output)
    hidden_momentum = initialize_weights(n_input, n_hidden, value=0)
    output_momentum = initialize_weights(n_hidden, n_output, value=0)

    for epoch in range(epochs):
        for x, target in training_data:
            hidden_activations = [sigmoid(sum(w_ji * x_i for w_ji, x_i in zip(hidden_weights[j], x))) for j in range(n_hidden)]
            output_activations = [sigmoid(sum(w_hk * h for w_hk, h in zip(output_weights[k], hidden_activations))) for k in range(n_output)]

            output_errors = [(target[k] - output_activations[k]) * output_activations[k] * (1 - output_activations[k]) for k in range(n_output)]
            hidden_errors = [hidden_activations[j] * (1 - hidden_activations[j]) * sum(output_errors[k] * output_weights[k][j] for k in range(n_output)) for j in range(n_hidden)]

            for k in range(n_output):
                for j in range(n_hidden):
                    delta = learning_rate * output_errors[k] * hidden_activations[j] + momentum * output_momentum[k][j]
                    output_weights[k][j] += delta
                    output_momentum[k][j] = delta

            for j in range(n_hidden):
                for i in range(n_input):
                    delta = learning_rate * hidden_errors[j] * x[i] + momentum * hidden_momentum[j][i]
                    hidden_weights[j][i] += delta
                    hidden_momentum[j][i] = delta

    return hidden_weights, output_weights
```

**4.6.2 Representational Power of Feedforward Networks**

**Key Concepts:**
- The expressiveness of feedforward networks depends on their width (number of units per layer) and depth (number of layers).

**Important Results:**
1. **Boolean Functions:**
   - Any boolean function can be represented exactly by a network with two layers of units, although the number of hidden units may grow exponentially with the number of inputs.

2. **Continuous Functions:**
   - Any bounded continuous function can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a network with two layers (one hidden layer with sigmoid units and an output layer with linear units).

3. **Arbitrary Functions:**
   - Any function can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy by a network with three layers (two hidden layers with sigmoid units and an output layer with linear units).

**Conclusion:**
- Feedforward networks are highly expressive and can represent a wide range of functions given sufficient width and depth.

---

**4.6.3 Hypothesis Space Search and Inductive Bias**

**Key Concepts:**
- Backpropagation searches the continuous hypothesis space of network weights using gradient descent.
- The inductive bias of backpropagation is the smooth interpolation between data points.

**Explanation:**
- The hypothesis space is continuous and differentiable, allowing for a structured search using gradients.
- Unlike discrete hypothesis spaces, the continuous nature of neural network weights provides a rich search space for optimization.

**Inductive Bias:**
- The tendency to label points between positive training examples as positive, resulting in smooth decision boundaries.
- This bias helps generalize beyond the training data by creating continuous decision surfaces.

---

**4.6.4 Hidden Layer Representations**

**Key Concepts:**
- Backpropagation can discover useful intermediate representations in the hidden layers.
- These representations capture important features of the input data that are relevant for the target function.

**Example:**
- A network learning the identity function for binary vectors (as shown in Figure 4.7) develops hidden layer encodings that resemble binary representations.

**Conclusion:**
- The ability to automatically discover and learn hidden representations is a key advantage of neural networks, enabling them to adapt to complex patterns in the data.

---

**4.6.5 Generalization, Overfitting, and Stopping Criterion**

**Key Concepts:**
- Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and idiosyncrasies that do not generalize to new data.
- Backpropagation can overfit if trained for too many iterations.

**Important Points:**
- Monitoring the error on a separate validation set helps prevent overfitting.
- Weight decay can be used to regularize the model by penalizing large weights.

**Stopping Criteria:**
1. **Validation Set Error:**
   - Stop training when the error on the validation set starts to increase, indicating potential overfitting.
2. **Weight Decay:**
   - Regularize the model by adding a penalty term to the error function for large weights.

**Illustration:**
- Figure 4.9 shows the error over training and validation sets, illustrating the risk of overfitting with prolonged training.

**Conclusion:**
- Proper stopping criteria and regularization techniques are essential for ensuring that neural networks generalize well to unseen data.
