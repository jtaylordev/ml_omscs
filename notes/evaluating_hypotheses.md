## 5.1 Motivation

### Key Concepts:
- Evaluating hypotheses is crucial for understanding their accuracy.
- Important for applications like medical treatments and decision tree pruning.
- Main challenges:
  - **Bias in the estimate**: Training accuracy often overestimates true accuracy due to overfitting.
  - **Variance in the estimate**: Small test sets lead to high variance in accuracy estimates.

### Concluding Remarks:
Understanding both bias and variance in hypothesis evaluation is essential to accurately gauge performance, especially with limited data.

## 5.2 Estimating Hypothesis Accuracy

### Key Concepts:
- **Sample Error**: The error rate of a hypothesis on a given data sample.
- **True Error**: The error rate of a hypothesis over the entire distribution of data.

### Important Equations:
1. **Sample Error (\( \text{errors}(h) \))**:
   \[
   \text{errors}(h) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \delta(f(x_i) \neq h(x_i))
   \]
2. **True Error (\( \text{error}_D(h) \))**:
   \[
   \text{error}_D(h) = \Pr_{x \sim D}[f(x) \neq h(x)]
   \]

### Concluding Remarks:
Accurate estimation of a hypothesis's performance requires careful consideration of both sample error and true error.

---

## 5.2.1 Sample Error and True Error

### Key Concepts:
- Distinction between sample error and true error.
- Need to estimate true error from sample error.

### Concluding Remarks:
Sample error provides an estimate, but true error is the goal for evaluating hypothesis performance.

---

## 5.2.2 Confidence Intervals for Discrete-Valued Hypotheses

### Key Concepts:
- **Confidence Intervals**: Provide a range within which the true error is likely to fall.
- **Normal Distribution Approximation**: Used for large sample sizes (n â‰¥ 30).

### Important Equations:
1. **95% Confidence Interval**:
   \[
   \text{error}_D(h) \approx \text{errors}(h) \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{\text{errors}(h)(1 - \text{errors}(h))}{n}}
   \]
2. **General N% Confidence Interval**:
   \[
   \text{error}_D(h) \approx \text{errors}(h) \pm Z_N \sqrt{\frac{\text{errors}(h)(1 - \text{errors}(h))}{n}}
   \]

### Concluding Remarks:
Confidence intervals are crucial for understanding the reliability of the estimated true error.

## 5.3 Basics of Sampling Theory

### Key Concepts:
- **Probability Distributions**: Describe the likelihood of different outcomes.
- **Expected Value and Variance**: Measure the central tendency and dispersion of a distribution.
- **Binomial and Normal Distributions**: Key distributions used in hypothesis evaluation.

### Important Equations:
1. **Expected Value**:
   \[
   E[Y] = \sum_{i} y_i \Pr(Y = y_i)
   \]
2. **Variance**:
   \[
   \text{Var}(Y) = E[(Y - E[Y])^2]
   \]
3. **Binomial Distribution**:
   \[
   \Pr(R = r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} p^r (1 - p)^{n-r}
   \]

### Concluding Remarks:
Understanding these basic statistical concepts is fundamental for evaluating hypotheses in machine learning.
