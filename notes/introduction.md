1.1 Well-Posed Learning Problems

**Notes:**
- Machine learning involves constructing computer programs that improve automatically with experience.
- For a learning problem to be well-defined, it must specify:
  - The **task** T that the program is trying to perform.
  - The **performance measure** P by which the program's performance at the task will be evaluated.
  - The **training experience** E that is available.

**Example of a Well-Posed Learning Problem:**
- Task (T): Playing checkers.
- Performance Measure (P): Percentage of games won against an opponent.
- Training Experience (E): Playing practice games against itself.

**Definition:**
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

**Examples:**
1. **Checkers Learning Problem**:
   - Task (T): Playing checkers.
   - Performance Measure (P): Percent of games won against an opponent.
   - Training Experience (E): Playing practice games against itself.

2. **Handwriting Recognition Learning Problem**:
   - Task (T): Recognizing and classifying handwritten words within images.
   - Performance Measure (P): Percent of words correctly classified.
   - Training Experience (E): A database of handwritten words with given classifications.

3. **Robot Driving Learning Problem**:
   - Task (T): Driving on public four-lane highways using vision sensors.
   - Performance Measure (P): Average distance traveled before an error (as judged by a human overseer).
   - Training Experience (E): A sequence of images and steering commands recorded while observing a human driver.

**Title:**
1.2 Designing a Learning System

**Notes:**
- Designing a learning system involves several key design choices that determine the success of the system.

**Example: Designing a Checkers-Playing Program:**
1. **Choosing the Training Experience:**
   - Type of training experience impacts the success of the learner.
   - **Direct Training Examples:** Specific board states and the correct move for each.
   - **Indirect Feedback:** Move sequences and game outcomes.

2. **Attributes of Training Experience:**
   - **Direct vs. Indirect Feedback:** Direct feedback is typically easier to learn from.
   - **Learner's Control:** Learner might have control over training examples, or rely on a teacher.
   - **Representativeness of Training Examples:** Training examples should ideally follow a distribution similar to future test examples.

3. **Choosing the Target Function:**
   - The function the system will learn.
   - **Example Target Function:** `ChooseMove: B -> M` (choosing the best move for any given board state).
   - In practice, it might be easier to learn an evaluation function `V: B -> R` that assigns a numerical score to board states.

4. **Choosing a Representation for the Target Function:**
   - Various options: a table, a set of rules, a polynomial function, or an artificial neural network.
   - Example: Represent `V(b)` as a linear combination of board features `x1, x2, ..., x6`.
     - Features: 
       - `x1`: Number of black pieces.
       - `x2`: Number of red pieces.
       - `x3`: Number of black kings.
       - `x4`: Number of red kings.
       - `x5`: Number of black pieces threatened by red.
       - `x6`: Number of red pieces threatened by black.

5. **Choosing a Function Approximation Algorithm:**
   - Learning algorithm to determine the weights for the target function.
   - Example: Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm for linear functions.

**Equations (if applicable):**
1. **Linear Combination for Evaluation Function:**
   \( V(b) = w_0 + w_1 \cdot x_1 + w_2 \cdot x_2 + w_3 \cdot x_3 + w_4 \cdot x_4 + w_5 \cdot x_5 + w_6 \cdot x_6 \)
   - `V(b)`: Evaluation function.
   - `w0, w1, ..., w6`: Weights to be learned.
   - `x1, x2, ..., x6`: Features of the board state.

2. **LMS Weight Update Rule:**
   \( w_i \leftarrow w_i + \eta (V_{\text{train}}(b) - \hat{V}(b)) \cdot x_i \)
   - `wi`: Weight to be updated.
   - `\eta`: Learning rate (small constant).
   - `V_{\text{train}}(b)`: Training value for board state `b`.
   - `\hat{V}(b)`: Current approximation of `V(b)`.

**Code (if applicable):**
- No specific code examples are provided in this section.

**Diagrams:**
1. **Checkers Learning System Design:**
   - Four Modules:
     - **Performance System:** Solves the performance task (playing checkers).
     - **Critic:** Produces training examples from game traces.
     - **Generalizer:** Learns from training examples to produce hypotheses.
     - **Experiment Generator:** Generates new problems for the Performance System to explore.

**Title:**
2.1 Introduction and 2.2 A Concept Learning Task

**Notes:**
- **Concept Learning:**
  - Involves inferring a boolean-valued function from training examples.
  - General concepts are acquired from specific training examples.
  - Concept learning can be viewed as the task of searching through a predefined space of potential hypotheses for the hypothesis that best fits the training examples.

- **Definitions:**
  - **Instance (X):** An individual example described by a set of attributes.
  - **Target Concept (c):** The actual concept or function to be learned.
  - **Hypothesis (H):** A proposed definition for the target concept based on the training examples.
  - **Training Examples (D):** Instances for which the target concept's value is known.

- **Example Task: EnjoySport**
  - **Attributes:**
    - Sky (values: Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy)
    - AirTemp (values: Warm, Cold)
    - Humidity (values: Normal, High)
    - Wind (values: Strong, Weak)
    - Water (values: Warm, Cool)
    - Forecast (values: Same, Change)
  - **Task:** Learn the concept "days on which my friend enjoys his favorite sport."
  - **Training Examples:**
    - Positive: Instances where EnjoySport = Yes
    - Negative: Instances where EnjoySport = No

- **Hypothesis Representation:**
  - Each hypothesis is a conjunction of constraints on the attributes.
  - Constraints can be:
    - "?" (any value is acceptable)
    - A specific value (e.g., Warm)
    - "0" (no value is acceptable)

- **Inductive Learning Hypothesis:**
  - Assumes that any hypothesis found to approximate the target function well over a sufficiently large set of training examples will also approximate the target function well over other unobserved examples.

- **Well-Posed Learning Problem:**
  - A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

**Equations (if applicable):**
- No specific equations are introduced in these sections.

**Code (if applicable):**

**Title:**
2.3 Concept Learning as Search

**Notes:**
- **Concept Learning as Search:**
  - Concept learning can be viewed as searching through a large space of hypotheses.
  - The goal is to find the hypothesis that best fits the training examples.

- **Hypothesis Space (H):**
  - Defined by the hypothesis representation chosen by the designer.
  - Can be very large or even infinite.

- **General-to-Specific Ordering of Hypotheses:**
  - A useful structure that organizes the hypothesis space.
  - Allows efficient search without explicitly enumerating every hypothesis.

- **Example:**
  - Hypotheses h1 and h2:
    - \( h1 = (Sunny, ?, ?, Strong, ?, ?) \)
    - \( h2 = (Sunny, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?) \)
  - \( h2 \) is more general than \( h1 \) because it classifies more instances as positive.
  - Formally, \( h2 \) is more-general-than-or-equal-to \( h1 \) if every instance satisfying \( h1 \) also satisfies \( h2 \).

**Definitions:**
- **Instance (x):** An individual example described by a set of attributes.
- **Hypothesis (h):** A boolean-valued function defined over the instance space X.
- **More-General-Than-Or-Equal-To (≥):**
  - \( h_j \geq h_k \) if every instance satisfying \( h_k \) also satisfies \( h_j \).

- **Partial Order:**
  - The ≥ relation defines a partial order over the hypothesis space H.
  - It is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.

**Concept Learning Algorithms:**
- Algorithms can leverage the general-to-specific ordering to search the hypothesis space efficiently.
- Examples include:
  - **FIND-S Algorithm:** Starts with the most specific hypothesis and generalizes it to cover positive examples.
  - Other algorithms explore different strategies for searching the hypothesis space.

**Equations (if applicable):**
- No specific equations are introduced in this section.

**Code (if applicable):**
- No specific code examples are provided in this section.

**Diagrams:**

1. **General-to-Specific Ordering:**
   - Diagram illustrating the relationship between hypotheses \( h1 \) and \( h2 \):
     - \( h1 = (Sunny, ?, ?, Strong, ?, ?) \)
     - \( h2 = (Sunny, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?) \)
   - Arrows indicate the direction of generalization.

2. **Concept Learning as Search:**
   - Diagram showing the hypothesis space H, instances X, and the partial order defined by the ≥ relation.

Description: The diagram consists of a set of instances and hypotheses connected by arrows indicating the more-general-than relationship. Hypothesis \( h2 \) is shown as more general than \( h1 \).

**Title:**
2.4 Finding a Maximally Specific Hypothesis

**Notes:**
- **FIND-S Algorithm:**
  - A method for finding a maximally specific hypothesis that fits the positive training examples.
  - Starts with the most specific hypothesis and generalizes it as necessary to cover positive examples.

- **Algorithm Steps:**
  1. Initialize \( h \) to the most specific hypothesis in \( H \).
  2. For each positive training instance \( x \):
     - For each attribute constraint \( a_i \) in \( h \):
       - If the constraint \( a_i \) is satisfied by \( x \), do nothing.
       - Else, replace \( a_i \) in \( h \) by the next more general constraint that is satisfied by \( x \).
  3. Output hypothesis \( h \).

- **Example: EnjoySport Task**
  - Initial hypothesis \( h = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) \).
  - After processing the first positive example (Sunny, Warm, Normal, Strong, Warm, Same), \( h \) becomes (Sunny, Warm, Normal, Strong, Warm, Same).
  - Further generalizations occur as more positive examples are processed.

**Pseudo Code:**
```python
def FIND_S(training_examples):
    # Initialize h to the most specific hypothesis in H
    h = ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']
    
    # For each positive training instance x
    for x in training_examples:
        if x.label == 'positive':
            # For each attribute constraint a_i in h
            for i in range(len(h)):
                # If the constraint a_i is not satisfied by x
                if h[i] != x.attributes[i]:
                    # Replace a_i in h by the next more general constraint that is satisfied by x
                    h[i] = '?' if h[i] == '0' else x.attributes[i]
    
    # Output hypothesis h
    return h
```

**Example Training Data:**
| Sky   | AirTemp | Humidity | Wind  | Water | Forecast | EnjoySport |
|-------|---------|----------|-------|-------|----------|------------|
| Sunny | Warm    | Normal   | Strong| Warm  | Same     | Yes        |
| Sunny | Warm    | High     | Strong| Warm  | Same     | Yes        |
| Rainy | Cold    | High     | Strong| Warm  | Change   | No         |
| Sunny | Warm    | High     | Strong| Cool  | Change   | Yes        |

- **Steps:**
  1. Initialize \( h = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) \).
  2. Process the first positive example:
     - \( h = (Sunny, Warm, Normal, Strong, Warm, Same) \).
  3. Process the second positive example:
     - \( h = (Sunny, Warm, ?, Strong, Warm, Same) \).
  4. Process the third (negative) example:
     - No change to \( h \).
  5. Process the fourth positive example:
     - \( h = (Sunny, Warm, ?, Strong, ?, ?) \).

**Equations (if applicable):**
- No specific equations are introduced in this section.

**Code (if applicable):**
- Pseudo code for the FIND-S algorithm is provided above.

**Diagrams:**
1. **FIND-S Algorithm Process:**
   - Diagram showing the initial hypothesis and the changes made after processing each training example.

Description: The diagram consists of a sequence of states for the hypothesis \( h \) as it is updated with each positive training example. Arrows indicate the changes made to \( h \) after each step.




**Title:**
2.5 Version Spaces and the CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION Algorithm

**Notes:**
- **Version Space:**
  - The subset of the hypothesis space \(H\) that is consistent with the observed training examples.
  - Defined by two sets of hypotheses:
    - \(S\): The set of maximally specific hypotheses.
    - \(G\): The set of maximally general hypotheses.

- **Version Space Representation Theorem:**
  - Any hypothesis \(h\) is in the version space \(VS_{H,D}\) if and only if there is some hypothesis \(s \in S\) and some hypothesis \(g \in G\) such that \(s \leq h \leq g\).

- **CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION Algorithm:**
  - Maintains the version space by updating \(S\) and \(G\) based on the training examples.
  - **Steps:**
    1. Initialize \(S\) to the set of most specific hypotheses in \(H\).
    2. Initialize \(G\) to the set of most general hypotheses in \(H\).
    3. For each training example \(d\):
       - If \(d\) is a positive example:
         - Remove from \(G\) any hypothesis that does not cover \(d\).
         - For each hypothesis \(s\) in \(S\) that does not cover \(d\):
           - Remove \(s\) from \(S\).
           - Add to \(S\) all minimal generalizations \(h\) of \(s\) such that \(h\) covers \(d\) and some member of \(G\) is more general than \(h\).
           - Remove from \(S\) any hypothesis that is more general than another hypothesis in \(S\).
       - If \(d\) is a negative example:
         - Remove from \(S\) any hypothesis that covers \(d\).
         - For each hypothesis \(g\) in \(G\) that covers \(d\):
           - Remove \(g\) from \(G\).
           - Add to \(G\) all minimal specializations \(h\) of \(g\) such that \(h\) does not cover \(d\) and some member of \(S\) is more specific than \(h\).
           - Remove from \(G\) any hypothesis that is less specific than another hypothesis in \(G\).
    4. Output the version space \(VS_{H,D}\) defined by \(S\) and \(G\).

**Pseudo Code:**
```python
def CANDIDATE_ELIMINATION(training_examples, H):
    S = [most specific hypothesis in H]
    G = [most general hypothesis in H]
    
    for d in training_examples:
        if d.label == 'positive':
            G = [g for g in G if g covers d]
            S_new = []
            for s in S:
                if not s covers d:
                    S_new.extend(minimal generalizations of s that cover d and are more specific than some g in G)
                else:
                    S_new.append(s)
            S = remove more general hypotheses from S_new
        elif d.label == 'negative':
            S = [s for s in S if not s covers d]
            G_new = []
            for g in G:
                if g covers d:
                    G_new.extend(minimal specializations of g that do not cover d and are more general than some s in S)
                else:
                    G_new.append(g)
            G = remove less specific hypotheses from G_new
    
    return S, G
```

**Example:**
- Consider a series of training examples for the EnjoySport task:
  - Positive Example: (Sunny, Warm, Normal, Strong, Warm, Same)
  - Negative Example: (Rainy, Cold, High, Strong, Warm, Change)
  - Positive Example: (Sunny, Warm, High, Strong, Warm, Same)
  - Use these examples to iteratively update \(S\) and \(G\).

Here are the notes for sections 2.5.1 "Representation" and 2.5.2 "The LIST-THEN-ELIMINATE Algorithm" from Chapter 2 of "Machine Learning" by Tom Mitchell:

**Title:**
2.5.1 Representation and 2.5.2 The LIST-THEN-ELIMINATE Algorithm

**Notes:**

**2.5.1 Representation:**
- **Hypothesis Representation:**
  - The hypotheses can be represented as conjunctions of attribute constraints.
  - Each attribute can be constrained to specific values, allowed to take any value ("?"), or prohibited from taking any value ("0").
  - Example Hypothesis: (Sunny, ?, ?, Strong, ?, ?)
    - This hypothesis specifies that the Sky must be Sunny and Wind must be Strong, but other attributes can take any value.

- **Generalization and Specialization:**
  - Generalization makes a hypothesis less restrictive (e.g., changing a specific value to "?").
  - Specialization makes a hypothesis more restrictive (e.g., changing "?" to a specific value).

**2.5.2 The LIST-THEN-ELIMINATE Algorithm:**
- **Overview:**
  - A brute-force method for finding all hypotheses consistent with the training data.
  - It generates all possible hypotheses and eliminates those inconsistent with any training example.

- **Steps:**
  1. Initialize the version space \( VS \) to include all hypotheses in \( H \).
  2. For each training example \( d \):
     - Remove from \( VS \) any hypothesis that is inconsistent with \( d \).
  3. Output the hypotheses in \( VS \).

**Pseudo Code:**
```python
def LIST_THEN_ELIMINATE(training_examples, H):
    # Initialize the version space to include all hypotheses
    VS = H.copy()
    
    # For each training example
    for d in training_examples:
        # Remove from VS any hypothesis inconsistent with d
        VS = [h for h in VS if h is consistent with d]
    
    # Output the version space
    return VS
```

**Example:**
- Consider the EnjoySport task with a hypothesis space \( H \) and a series of training examples.
  - Positive Example: (Sunny, Warm, Normal, Strong, Warm, Same)
  - Negative Example: (Rainy, Cold, High, Strong, Warm, Change)
  - Positive Example: (Sunny, Warm, High, Strong, Warm, Same)
- Apply the LIST-THEN-ELIMINATE algorithm to iteratively eliminate inconsistent hypotheses from \( H \).

**Equations (if applicable):**
- No specific equations are introduced in these sections.

**Code (if applicable):**
- Pseudo code for the LIST-THEN-ELIMINATE algorithm is provided above.

**Title:**
2.6 Remarks on Version Spaces and CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION

**Notes:**
- **2.6.1 Will the CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION Algorithm Converge to the Correct Hypothesis?**
  - The CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithm will converge to the correct hypothesis if:
    - There is a hypothesis in the hypothesis space \(H\) that correctly describes the target concept.
    - There are no errors in the training examples.
    - The learner is given a sufficiently large and representative set of training examples.

- **2.6.2 What Training Example Should the Learner Request Next?**
  - To efficiently converge to the correct hypothesis, the learner should request training examples that will maximally reduce the version space.
  - This can be done by choosing examples that:
    - Split the current version space in half.
    - Provide the most information about which hypotheses are consistent with the target concept.

- **2.6.3 How Can Partially Learned Concepts Be Used?**
  - Partially learned concepts (version spaces that are not reduced to a single hypothesis) can still be useful.
  - They can be used to:
    - Make predictions with a measure of uncertainty.
    - Identify regions of the instance space where additional training examples would be most informative.
    - Provide bounds on the possible classifications of new instances.

**Pseudo Code:**
- Not applicable for these sections.

**Equations (if applicable):**
- No specific equations are introduced in these sections.

**Code (if applicable):**
- Not applicable for these sections.

**Title:**
2.7 Inductive Bias

**Notes:**
- **2.7.1 A Biased Hypothesis Space**
  - Inductive bias refers to the assumptions a learning algorithm makes to generalize beyond the training data.
  - A biased hypothesis space restricts the learner to a subset of all possible hypotheses.
  - Bias is necessary for learning to be feasible and effective.
  - Example: Preferring simpler hypotheses (Occam's Razor).

- **2.7.2 An Unbiased Learner**
  - An unbiased learner makes no assumptions beyond the training data.
  - In theory, an unbiased learner can represent any possible hypothesis.
  - In practice, an unbiased learner is impractical because it would require an infeasibly large number of training examples to generalize effectively.

- **2.7.3 The Futility of Bias-Free Learning**
  - Bias-free learning is not practical or possible in most real-world scenarios.
  - All learning algorithms must have some form of inductive bias to function effectively.
  - The challenge is to choose a bias that leads to good generalization from limited data.

**Pseudo Code:**
- Not applicable for these sections.

**Equations (if applicable):**
- No specific equations are introduced in these sections.

**Code (if applicable):**
- Not applicable for these sections.
