### Instance-Based Learning - Detailed Study Notes

---

#### **8.1 Introduction**

**Key Concepts:**
- **Instance-Based Learning:** Stores training examples and generalizes only when a new instance is classified. It includes methods like nearest neighbor and locally weighted regression.
- **Lazy Learning:** Delays processing until a new instance is classified, allowing local approximation of the target function.
- **Complex Representations:** Case-based reasoning uses more complex, symbolic representations for instances.

**Concluding Remarks:**
Instance-based learning methods offer flexibility by deferring generalization, making them suitable for complex target functions that can be approximated locally.

#### **8.2 k-Nearest Neighbor Learning**

**Title:** k-Nearest Neighbor Learning Algorithm

**Key Concepts:**
- **Basic Algorithm:** Assumes instances are points in an n-dimensional space. Classifies a new instance based on the k nearest training examples.
- **Distance Metric:** Uses Euclidean distance to measure similarity.
- **Discrete-Valued Target Functions:** For discrete targets, the algorithm returns the most common value among the k nearest neighbors.
- **Continuous-Valued Target Functions:** For continuous targets, the algorithm returns the mean value of the k nearest neighbors.

**Important Equations:**
- **Euclidean Distance:** \( d(x_i, x_j) = \sqrt{\sum_{r=1}^{n} (a_r(x_i) - a_r(x_j))^2} \)
- **Distance-Weighted Neighbor:** \( f(x_q) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i f(x_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i} \) where \( w_i = \frac{1}{d(x_q, x_i)^2} \)

**Concluding Remarks:**
k-Nearest Neighbor is a simple and effective algorithm for classification and regression, sensitive to the choice of distance metric and number of neighbors (k).

#### **8.3 Locally Weighted Regression**

**Title:** Locally Weighted Regression (LWR)

**Key Concepts:**
- **Local Approximation:** Constructs an explicit approximation to the target function in the neighborhood of a query instance.
- **Weighted Examples:** Uses distance-weighted examples to form the local approximation.
- **Functional Forms:** Can use various forms like linear, quadratic, or more complex functions for local approximation.

**Important Equations:**
- **Locally Weighted Error Criterion:** \( E(x_q) = \sum_{x \in D} K(d(x_q, x))(f(x) - \hat{f}(x))^2 \)
- **Gradient Descent Update Rule:** Adjusts weights to minimize the local error.

**Concluding Remarks:**
Locally weighted regression generalizes k-nearest neighbor by fitting a local model, providing flexibility and improved performance in many scenarios.

#### **8.4 Radial Basis Functions**

**Title:** Radial Basis Function Networks

**Key Concepts:**
- **RBF Networks:** Combines instance-based methods and neural networks, using localized kernel functions to approximate the target function.
- **Gaussian Kernels:** Common choice for kernel functions, providing smooth, localized influence.
- **Two-Stage Training:** First, define kernel functions; second, optimize weights to fit the target function.

**Important Equations:**
- **Gaussian Kernel Function:** \( K_u(d(x_u, x)) = e^{-\frac{d(x_u, x)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \)
- **Global Approximation:** \( f(x) = \sum_{u=1}^{k} w_u K_u(d(x_u, x)) \)

**Concluding Remarks:**
RBF networks offer a powerful method for function approximation, combining local and global modeling techniques for efficient learning.

#### **8.5 Case-Based Reasoning**

**Title:** Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)

**Key Concepts:**
- **Symbolic Representations:** Uses complex, symbolic descriptions for instances.
- **Retrieval and Adaptation:** Retrieves similar cases from a library and adapts them to solve new problems.
- **Knowledge-Based Inference:** Employs domain knowledge to refine and combine retrieved cases.

**Example Application:**
- **CADET System:** Assists in conceptual design by retrieving and adapting past design cases.

**Concluding Remarks:**
CBR extends instance-based learning to domains with rich symbolic representations, leveraging past cases and domain knowledge for problem-solving.

#### **8.6 Remarks on Lazy and Eager Learning**

**Title:** Lazy vs. Eager Learning

**Key Concepts:**
- **Lazy Learning:** Defers generalization until a query is received, allowing localized approximations.
- **Eager Learning:** Generalizes during training, committing to a single global approximation.
- **Inductive Bias:** Lazy methods can adapt their hypothesis to each query instance, while eager methods must choose a single hypothesis for all instances.

**Concluding Remarks:**
The choice between lazy and eager learning depends on the problem requirements, with lazy methods offering flexibility and eager methods providing efficiency.
