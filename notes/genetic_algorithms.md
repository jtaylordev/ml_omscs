#### **9.2 Genetic Algorithms**

**Title:** Structure and Functioning of Genetic Algorithms

**Key Concepts:**
- **Population:** A set of hypotheses that evolves over generations.
- **Fitness Function:** Evaluates the quality of hypotheses.
- **Selection, Crossover, Mutation:** Core genetic operations to generate new hypotheses.
- **Algorithm Structure:** Iteratively evaluates and updates the population based on fitness.

**Prototypical Algorithm:**
1. Initialize population \( P \)
2. Evaluate each hypothesis \( h \) in \( P \)
3. While \(\max \text{Fitness}(h)\) < Fitness\_threshold:
   - Select hypotheses for next generation
   - Apply crossover to produce offspring
   - Apply mutation to some offspring
   - Evaluate new population
4. Return hypothesis with the highest fitness

**Important Terms:**
- **Fitness:** Numerical measure of hypothesis quality.
- **Crossover:** Combines parts of two parents to create offspring.
- **Mutation:** Introduces random changes to hypotheses.

**Concluding Remarks:**
GAs perform a parallel, randomized search for optimal hypotheses, effectively exploring complex hypothesis spaces through evolutionary operations.

  - \( \text{Outlook} = \text{Overcast} \vee \text{Rain} \) and \( \text{Wind} = \text{Strong} \)
  - Encoded as bit string: \( 01110 \)

**Concluding Remarks:**
Bit string representations allow flexible encoding of complex hypotheses, supporting genetic operations like crossover and mutation.

#### **9.2.2 Genetic Operators**

**Title:** Genetic Operators in Genetic Algorithms

**Key Concepts:**
- **Crossover:** Creates offspring by combining bits from two parents.
  - **Single-Point Crossover:** Splits bit strings at a random point.
  - **Two-Point Crossover:** Swaps segments between two crossover points.
  - **Uniform Crossover:** Randomly selects bits from each parent.
- **Mutation:** Introduces random changes by flipping bits in a bit string.

**Example:**
- **Single-Point Crossover:**
  - Parents: \( 1100110 \) and \( 1010101 \)
  - Crossover Point: After 4th bit
  - Offspring: \( 1100101 \) and \( 1010110 \)

**Concluding Remarks:**
Crossover and mutation are essential for introducing diversity and exploring the hypothesis space, ensuring robust evolution.

**Title:** Fitness Evaluation and Selection in Genetic Algorithms

**Key Concepts:**
- **Fitness Proportionate Selection:** Probabilistically selects hypotheses based on fitness.
- **Tournament Selection:** Chooses the best hypothesis from random subsets.
- **Rank Selection:** Selects based on the rank of hypotheses rather than raw fitness.

**Example:**
- **Fitness Proportionate Selection:**
  - Hypotheses: \( h1, h2, h3 \) with fitness \( 0.2, 0.5, 0.3 \)
  - Selection Probability: \( P(h1) = 0.2, P(h2) = 0.5, P(h3) = 0.3 \)

**Concluding Remarks:**
The fitness function guides the selection process, ensuring that the most promising hypotheses have a higher chance of producing offspring.
