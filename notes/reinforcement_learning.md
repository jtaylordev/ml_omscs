### Reinforcement Learning - Detailed Study Notes

---

#### **13.1 Introduction**

**Key Concepts:**
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Focuses on how an autonomous agent can learn to perform actions to maximize cumulative rewards.
- **Applications:** Learning to control robots, optimize operations, and play games.
- **Agent's Task:** Learn from indirect, delayed rewards to select actions that produce the greatest cumulative reward.

**Concluding Remarks:**
Reinforcement learning allows agents to learn optimal control strategies from delayed rewards without prior knowledge of action effects on the environment.

---

#### **13.2 The Learning Task**

**Key Concepts:**
- **Markov Decision Processes (MDP):** Framework where the agent perceives states, performs actions, receives rewards, and transitions to new states.
- **Policy (\(\pi\)):** The strategy the agent learns to select actions based on the current state.
- **Objective:** Learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative discounted reward.

**Important Equations:**
- **Cumulative Reward (\(V^\pi(s)\)):**
  \[
  V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t r_t \mid s_0 = s, \pi\right]
  \]
  where \(\gamma\) is the discount factor.

**Concluding Remarks:**
The goal of reinforcement learning is to develop a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward, balancing immediate and future rewards.

#### **13.3 Q-Learning**

**Key Concepts:**
- **Q-Learning:** A model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the value of action-state pairs.
- **Q-Function (\(Q(s, a)\)):** Measures the expected utility of taking action \(a\) in state \(s\) and following the optimal policy thereafter.
- **Bellman Equation for Q-Learning:**
  \[
  Q(s, a) = r(s, a) + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a')
  \]

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize \(Q(s, a)\) arbitrarily for all \(s, a\).
2. Observe current state \(s\).
3. Repeat for each episode:
   - Choose action \(a\) using a policy derived from \(Q\) (e.g., \(\epsilon\)-greedy).
   - Take action \(a\), observe reward \(r\) and new state \(s'\).
   - Update \(Q(s, a)\) using:
     \[
     Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)\right]
     \]
   - \(s \leftarrow s'\).

**Concluding Remarks:**
Q-learning iteratively updates the Q-values to converge to the optimal action-value function, allowing the agent to learn the best policy for maximizing rewards.

#### **13.4 Non-deterministic Rewards and Actions**

**Key Concepts:**
- **Non-deterministic MDPs:** Where state transitions and rewards are probabilistic.
- **Q-Function in Non-deterministic MDPs:**
  \[
  Q(s, a) = r(s, a) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P(s' | s, a) \max_{a'} Q(s', a')
  \]
- **Training Rule for Q-learning in Non-deterministic MDPs:**
  \[
  Q_{n+1}(s, a) \leftarrow (1 - \alpha_n) Q_n(s, a) + \alpha_n \left[r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q_n(s', a')\right]
  \]

**Concluding Remarks:**
Adapting Q-learning to non-deterministic environments involves using expected values for state transitions and rewards, ensuring the algorithm can handle uncertainty.

---

#### **13.5 Temporal Difference Learning**

**Key Concepts:**
- **Temporal Difference (TD) Learning:** Generalizes Q-learning by blending estimates over multiple steps.
- **TD(λ):** Combines n-step returns to create more robust value estimates.
  \[
  Q_\lambda(s, a) = (1 - \lambda) \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \lambda^{n-1} Q^{(n)}(s, a)
  \]
  where \(Q^{(n)}(s, a)\) are n-step returns.

**Concluding Remarks:**
TD learning, particularly TD(λ), offers a more flexible framework for learning from rewards distributed over time, improving convergence and stability.

---

#### **13.6 Generalizing from Examples**

**Key Concepts:**
- **Function Approximation:** Replaces explicit lookup tables with generalizing function approximators (e.g., neural networks) to handle large state-action spaces.
- **Neural Networks:** Used to estimate Q-values, updating weights using gradient descent based on TD errors.

**Concluding Remarks:**
Function approximation enables reinforcement learning to scale to larger problems, leveraging generalization to predict values for unseen states and actions.

#### **13.7 Relationship to Dynamic Programming**

**Key Concepts:**
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Solves MDPs by iteratively updating value functions using known transition models.
- **Q-learning vs DP:** Q-learning does not require prior knowledge of the environment's model, making it more flexible for real-world applications.

**Important Equations:**
- **Bellman Equation (DP):**
  \[
  V(s) = \max_a \left[ r(s, a) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P(s' | s, a) V(s') \right]
  \]

**Concluding Remarks:**
Reinforcement learning algorithms like Q-learning extend dynamic programming techniques to settings where the environment's model is unknown, enabling learning through direct interaction.

#### **13.8 Summary and Further Reading**

**Further Reading:**
