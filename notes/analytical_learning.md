### Analytical Learning - Detailed Study Notes

---

#### **11.1 Introduction**

**Key Concepts:**
- **Inductive Learning:** Requires numerous training examples to achieve generalization accuracy, bounded by theoretical and experimental limits.
- **Analytical Learning:** Uses prior knowledge and deductive reasoning to augment training examples, not subject to the same bounds.
- **Explanation-Based Learning (EBL):** Uses prior knowledge to explain training examples, identifying relevant features for generalization based on logical reasoning.

**Concluding Remarks:**
Analytical learning, particularly EBL, enhances generalization accuracy by leveraging prior knowledge to focus on relevant features, differing from purely inductive methods.

#### **11.1.1 Inductive and Analytical Learning Problems**

**Key Concepts:**
- **Inductive Learning:** Learner selects a hypothesis from a given hypothesis space based on training examples.
- **Analytical Learning:** Learner uses a hypothesis space, training examples, and a domain theory (background knowledge) to find a hypothesis consistent with both training data and domain theory.

**Example:**
- **Chess Learning Task:** Learning to recognize chessboard positions where black will lose its queen within two moves. Inductive methods require thousands of examples; analytical methods leverage prior knowledge of chess rules for more efficient learning.

**Concluding Remarks:**
Analytical learning incorporates domain theory to reduce hypothesis space complexity, improving learning efficiency and generalization accuracy.

#### **11.2 Learning with Perfect Domain Theories: PROLOG-EBG**

**Title:** PROLOG-EBG Algorithm

**Key Concepts:**
- **Perfect Domain Theory:** A domain theory that is both correct and complete.
- **Sequential Covering Algorithm:** Learns one Horn clause at a time, refining the hypothesis until all positive examples are covered.
- **Explanation-Based Generalization (EBG):** Constructs explanations for positive examples, generalizes explanations to form new rules.

**Algorithm:**
1. Explain: Construct an explanation for the positive example.
2. Analyze: Identify the most general set of features sufficient for the target concept.
3. Refine: Add a new Horn clause to the hypothesis.

**Concluding Remarks:**
PROLOG-EBG uses perfect domain theories to ensure correctness and completeness in learning, efficiently forming justified general hypotheses.

#### **11.2.1 An Illustrative Trace**

**Title:** Illustrative Example of PROLOG-EBG

**Key Concepts:**
- **Training Example:** SafeToStack(Obj1, Obj2) with specific attributes.
- **Explanation:** Constructs a proof that Obj1 can be safely stacked on Obj2 using domain theory.
- **Weakest Preimage:** Most general set of initial assertions that entail the target concept based on the explanation.

**Example Steps:**
1. Explain: Generate proof for SafeToStack(Obj1, Obj2).
2. Analyze: Identify relevant features (e.g., Volume, Density, Type).
3. Refine: Formulate a general rule justified by the explanation.

**Concluding Remarks:**
The illustrative trace demonstrates the step-by-step process of PROLOG-EBG, highlighting the construction and generalization of explanations.
